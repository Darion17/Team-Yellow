Gather requirements and initial information: Gather all relevant information about the project, including project requirements and specifications, input from stakeholders about what they expect, technical constraints and limitations, and existing system documentation (if applicable). Starting with a solid foundation of information ensures that your design document accurately reflects the project's goals and constraints. 
Outline the system architecture: With the requirements identified, outline the overall system architecture. Identify major components and subsystems, define how these components relate to each other, and make high-level design decisions. Choose appropriate design patterns and architectural styles that will guide the rest of the development process.
